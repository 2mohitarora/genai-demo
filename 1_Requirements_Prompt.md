# Prompt to finalize Functional Requirements

We will execute these steps in Claude Desktop

1. Copy contents of `prompts/input/Concept.md` in this repo 
2. Open claude and paste it (I am using claude desktop app)
3. Iterate on the final requirements.
4. once you are happy with functional requirements, copy the contents.
5. You can check contents of `prompts/output/Project_Description.md` for requirements that i finalized after many iterations.
